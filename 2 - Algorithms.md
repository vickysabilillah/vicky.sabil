# Algorithms

## Types of Algorithms

### Iterative

- An algorithm that is called repeatedly but for a finite number of times, each time being a single iteration.
- Often used to move incrementally through a dataset.

### Recursive

- An algorithm that calls itself in its definition.
- The **recursive case** in a conditional statement is used to trigger the recursion.
- The **base case** in a conditional statement is used to break the recursion.

### Greedy

- An algorithm that follows the problem solving heuristic of making the locally optimal choice at each stage with the hope of finding a global optimum.
- The general five components, taken from [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greedy_algorithm#Specifics):
    - A **candidate set**, from which a solution is created.
    - A **selection function**, which chooses the best candidate to be added to the solution.
    - A **feasibility function**, which is used to determine if a candidate can be used to contribute to a solution.
    - An **objective function**, which assigns a value to a solution, or a partial solution.
    - A **solution function**, which will indicate when we have discovered a complete solution.
